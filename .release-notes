- Lower Ruby version requirement from `3.2.2` to `2.7.0`.
- Add `Arj::QueryDocumentation` to provide documentation and autocomplete for `ActiveRecord::Relation` query methods.
- Add support for queries like `Arj.select(:job_class)`. `Arj::Relation` now returns records in this case.

- Remove `Arj::Job`. Customization is now achieved via `ActiveJob` calbacks.
- Fix bug causing jobs to be discarded when an error occurrs on re-enqueue.
- Fix `Enumerable` support in `ArjRelation`. Add documentation.
- Add Arj-specific query methods: `todo`, `failing`, `executable`, `queue`.
- Allow jobs to enqueue / re-enqueue themselves while executing.
